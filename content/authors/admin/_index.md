I am a cognitive neuroscientist at Columbia University in the City of New York. My research focuses on the neurobiological foundations of spatial navigation and memory in humans. To unravel the neural key mechanisms underlying these functions, I employ cutting-edge research methods including single-neuron recordings, intracranial EEG, and functional MRI.
