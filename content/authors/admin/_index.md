My research focuses on understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie spatial navigation and memory in humans. Using behavioral virtual-reality tasks in combination with human single-neuron recordings, I aim to identify specific types of neurons and brain oscillations that allow humans to successfully navigate their environments and to remember past experiences in these environments. In translational studies, I build on the fundamental insights from the single-neuron recordings to understand how neural mechanisms of spatial navigation and memory are impaired in adults at risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Using electrical brain stimulation, I investigate whether impaired mechanisms of navigation and memory can be restored. My research thus provides insights into the workings of the human brain, identifies their impairments in Alzheimer’s disease, and explores novel ways to modulate neural activity in humans.
